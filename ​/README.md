# 🦈 Aura AI: Decentralized Intelligence Layer

## 🛡️ Problem
Retail traders lose due to institutional info-monopoly. High-frequency data is too complex, and AI forecasts are often opaque and unverified.

## 🚀 Solution
Aura AI provides institutional-grade analytics using **Llama-3 (Groq)** and **CatBoost**. 
Every signal is committed to **BNB Chain** as "Proof of Inference", making accuracy 100% verifiable.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **AI:** Llama-3-70B, CatBoost Ensemble
- **Blockchain:** BNB Chain (Solidity)
- **Data:** Binance Futures HFT Feeds

## 📦 Project Structure
- `/contracts`: Solidity Oracle for Proof of Inference.
- `/src`: Market monitoring and AI integration layer.
- `/dashboard`: Institutional visualization UI.

## ⚖️ License
MIT. The core ML weights and P=NP heuristic algorithms are proprietary.
