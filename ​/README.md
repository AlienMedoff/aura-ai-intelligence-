# 🦈 AURA AI: Quantum GPS v14.0
### Decentralized Intelligence Layer for BNB Chain
**"In a sea of noise, we follow the liquidity."**

---

## 🛡️ Problem
Retail traders consistently lose to institutional information monopolies. Modern market data is too high-frequency for human processing, and existing AI "black box" forecasts are often opaque, unverified, and prone to survivorship bias.

## 🚀 Solution: The Aura Protocol
Aura AI democratizes institutional-grade analytics. By combining **Llama-3 (Groq)** reasoning with **CatBoost** pattern recognition, we detect whale activity and liquidity gaps in real-time. 

**The Game Changer:** Every signal is committed to the BNB Chain as a **"Proof of Inference" (PoI)**. This makes our predictive accuracy 100% verifiable and immutable.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **AI Engine:** Llama-3-70B (via Groq LPU), CatBoost Ensemble Logic.
* **Blockchain:** BNB Chain (Solidity v0.8.20).
* **Data Ingestion:** Binance Futures HFT Feeds (REST + WebSockets).
* **Frontend:** Quantum Terminal UI (TailwindCSS, Orbitron Design).

## 📦 Project Structure
* `/contracts` — **AuraCore.sol**: Solidity Oracle for anchoring Proof of Inference.
* `/src` — **aura_core.py**: Market monitoring, HFT ingestion, and AI reasoning layer.
* `/dashboard` — **index.html**: Institutional-grade visualization UI for real-time monitoring.

## 🧠 Core Logic: A.X.E.L. Engine v5.5
The **Aura X-Linked Engine for Liquidity (A.X.E.L.)** focuses on three proprietary metrics:
1. **V-Ratio:** Volume-to-Open-Interest divergence detection.
2. **Whale Trap Sensing:** Identifying institutional distribution zones.
3. **PCM 4.0:** Psychological Margin Correction for exhaustion filtering.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

### 1. Web Terminal (Frontend)
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser. 
> **Note:** Access requires a Neural Link Key (Groq API Key).

### 2. Backend Engine (Python)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python aura_core.py
